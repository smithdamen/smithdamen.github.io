title: What Everybody Ought to Know About Studying Web Design

### How to come into the web design program with the right mindset to succeed.

A couple years ago I started going in the web design program with the Art Institutes. I have appreciated all the things I've learned since I started going to school as well as the skills I've acquired. One thing I wish I knew coming into the program is more about what it actually means to be in the web design industry and work in that field. Basically, upon registering for classes for the first time, I was thrown into the mix of classes studying everything from 2D design, to art history, to photoshop, to English. It was overwhelming, to say the least.

Now that I have less than a year until I graduate, the big picture is starting to come together. I am starting to understand what the people in the industry are doing, what tools they are using, and what methods I should be following to create projects that are similar to what industry professionals are creating.

##### My advice to you

Don't wait until you have finished all of your prerequisite classes and get deeply involved in the web program before you do some research on what it is like working in the field of web development and see what some other people are working on. I have lately been trying to think of every assignment I get in school as part of an overall workflow. I try and look at an assignment as if it was part of a bigger project and determine what stage of a larger workflow it would fit into.

Doing this has allowed me to have a fresher perspective on the work that I'm being assigned and try and think of it in "real-world" terms instead of just looking at it as an assignment I have to finish before I can get a grade and move on.

##### Develop a method to the madness

Once you've taken on this fresh perspective, it becomes important to keep yourself focused and organized in order to not become overwhelmed. I recently adopted the [Bullet Journal method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm15cmYU0IM) to keep my tasks and important deadlines organized so I know what I need to get done for each day/week.

##### Conclusion

My final piece of advice is to just ask a lot of questions. Your instructors and department heads are there to help you. Feel free to ask them as many questions you want, since, that's what they get paid for right? I have found that the majority of my instructors are always willing to make themselves available and help with whatever they can. They want you to succeed.

One of the most common things I always ask about is, "how does this fit into a real-life workflow?" For me, it always helps if I understand why I'm learning something and what I will be using it for. This helps keep me motivated to keep learning more about it since I know it will allow me to do some cool things in the future.

I hope this has helped you out a little bit. Getting a college degree and seeing it through to the end is quite a daunting task. Just remember how many others out there are working towards the same goal and you have to make it to the finish line.
