title: Personal Update

For the past several years, I have always been interested in blogging. I've never been able to stick to a regular schedule and post about things that I thought were relevant and interesting, not only to myself, but to potential readers. Well, I've decided to give it another try.

Now that I'm less than a year from graduating with a BFA in web design, I think it's time to start keeping up with some regular blog postings and use this page as a place to talk about the different things that I'm learning and various projects I'm working on.

##### Purpose

There are two main purposes for this blog:
  * producing content that is directly related to projects concerning my studies that can be beneficial for others
  * discussion related to personal projects and information regarding those projects

Now that I am constantly working on new things with each passing week, I am looking forward to posting about it and having a place to share some of the knowledge that I have gained throughout my time studying web design and development.
